# Global_Air_Quality
Brief Overview:

Air pollution is one of the leading environmental health risks. This case study analyzes global air quality data to identify patterns and help predict pollution levels.

Key Objectives:
* Understand global air pollution trends.
* Identify highly polluted areas.
* Apply predictive modeling techniques to estimate air quality.

Problem Statement:

Poor air quality affects public health and the environment. Predicting pollution levels can help governments and organizations implement timely measures to mitigate the effects.

 Dataset Description:
* *Source:* Unknown (you may provide a valid source)
* *Size:* 10,000 entries
* *Key Features:* Country, city, pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.), date, AQI (Air Quality Index)

 Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes air quality readings from various global cities with timestamps and pollutant levels, allowing temporal and regional trend analysis.

Approach:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Predictive modeling using machine learning

 Algorithms Used:
* *Linear Regression:* For AQI prediction
* *K-Means Clustering:* To group cities based on pollution
* *Random Forest:* To improve predictive accuracy

Methodology:
* Handled missing values
* Visualized data using seaborn/matplotlib
* Trained and evaluated ML models using scikit-learn
* Compared performance metrics (RMSE, R²)

 Conclusion:

ML models effectively predicted AQI with acceptable accuracy. The clustering revealed pollution hotspots, guiding policymakers.

 Future Work:
* Use real-time streaming data
* Incorporate weather and traffic data
* Deploy a web app dashboard for continuous monitoring
